Doing a late night stream, something to help my partner Nicole fall asleep to.
<!--more-->
She falls asleep to watching Youtubers play games, and who better to watch then her partner? I'm obviously not an actual streamer, and don't even have 100 followers on Twitch or Youtube or anything. Hell, I had my Youtube since I was young and I only have MAYBE 80 subscribers total at this point. Which honestly, I don't really mind, being famous always seems to come with some quirks, not the good kind. Anyhow, I'm actually typing this up on my stream right now, which you can find [right here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anXWiT-eDp0)! I'm assuming once I am done, this will be the footage of said stream.

Streaming isn't terribly hard to do, the hardest to be a serious one in my opinion is probably having the right equipment. I mean look at me now with my decent camera and no lighting at all. I was literally spending the past 20 minutes laughing my ass off that tomstrohl.com is a redirect to a switzerland medical shop, specifically on a product of viagra. I don't know who is named Tom Strohl over there, but they are getting pranked, and it is funny. No offense, other Tom. Hehehe. Point being, the webpage was a white background, so you see my face being flashbanged the whole time. Now as I write this on my dark mode VS Code, it looks a lot better. Point being, serious streamers usually have a proper light, sometimes a green screen to hide their background, or other professional equipment. I mean I'm literally using a decent Elgato camera, and a Steelseries headset, with the microphone. I used to have a blue snowball (or whatever they're called) and swapping between headset and that, my friends on Discord say the difference is ridiculous on how much clearer I sound on said snowball.

Some people also opt to be Vtubers, which is essentially just taking a 3d model, the streamer's "avatar", and then have it linked to their camera so their actual body moves the avatar. More professional equipment like certain cameras are built in a way with much better tracking of the body. Some really serious streamers even use equipment on their body for better tracking, kind of like how some VR players have full body tracking with trackers all over their body. There does also exist PNGtubers, which is essentially the same thing but instead of a full tracked model, it's just variations of an image that change based on actions, either by speaking or manually controlling the actions. I actually like the idea of a PNGtuber and would like to set one up for myself one day, even though I'm not likely to be a serious streamer. If anything, Nicole is more likely to do so.

Speaking of which, Nicole actually made a bunch of them for my friends and I for our gaming channel, [THE UNCLES](https://www.youtube.com/@TheUncleOrganization). It's linked to our discord calls, so that on my streaming software OBS, it knows who is who, and links their images to them, so whoever is speaking it shows them as speaking. It's relatively simple, but looks really cool! Pretty neat overall.

That's about it for this post, more of a demonstration of my blog site on the stream itself. I will now indulge myself in Stoneblock 4. Check out the stream/stream VOD if you have time (and by have time I mean be extremely bored with nothing else to do as I am not particularly interesting).
